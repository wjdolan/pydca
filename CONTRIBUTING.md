# Contributing to Decline Curve Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Decline Curve Analysis library! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decline-curve.git
   cd decline-curve
   ```

2. **Create Development Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=decline_curve --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py -v

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black decline_curve/ tests/

# Sort imports with isort
isort decline_curve/ tests/

# Lint with flake8
flake8 decline_curve/ tests/

# Type check with mypy
mypy decline_curve/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)

Install pre-commit hooks to automatically check code before committing:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use Black for code formatting (line length: 88)
- Use isort for import sorting
- Add type hints to all functions
- Write descriptive docstrings (Google style)

### Example Docstring

```python
def forecast(
    series: pd.Series,
    model: str = "arps",
    horizon: int = 12
) -> pd.Series:
    """Generate production forecast using specified model.

    Args:
        series: Historical production time series
        model: Forecasting model ('arps', 'arima', 'timesfm', 'chronos')
        horizon: Number of periods to forecast

    Returns:
        Forecasted production series

    Raises:
        ValueError: If series is empty or model is invalid

    Example:
        >>> series = pd.Series([100, 90, 80], index=pd.date_range('2020-01', periods=3, freq='MS'))
        >>> forecast = dca.forecast(series, model='arps', horizon=6)
    """
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Include edge cases and error conditions

```python
def test_forecast_with_valid_data():
    """Test forecast generates correct output with valid input."""
    series = pd.Series([100, 90, 80], index=pd.date_range('2020-01', periods=3, freq='MS'))
    result = dca.forecast(series, model='arps', horizon=6)

    assert len(result) == 9  # 3 historical + 6 forecast
    assert all(result > 0)  # All values positive
    assert result.index.freq == 'MS'  # Correct frequency
```

### Documentation

- Update docstrings for modified functions
- Add examples to documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Build docs locally to verify:
  ```bash
  cd docs/
  make html
  open _build/html/index.html
  ```
